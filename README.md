# RFId-Doorlock-Iot-proj
- The arduino based RFID door lock system is secure and responsive as compared to other systems. With the use of arduino, it becomes much easier to design. Program a code and upload it to arduino just like a plug and play device. It is a simple and cost efficient project and can be used as a basic access control mechanism. Their main advantage is contactless communication and RFID tags can work in any environmental conditions.
